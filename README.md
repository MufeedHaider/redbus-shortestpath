# redbus-shortestpath
This C++ program simulates a red bus route system using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between bus stops. It leverages a custom implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm designed by the team to efficiently compute optimal routes and manage bus stop connectivity for an enhanced transportation experience.
